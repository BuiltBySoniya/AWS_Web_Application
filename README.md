## 🧩 Problem Statement

Many web applications face downtime and performance issues during sudden user traffic surges.
To address this, the project aimed to design an AWS-native architecture that could:

✅ Scale automatically under high load

✅ Maintain zero downtime across multiple availability zones

✅ Optimize compute costs through dynamic resource management

## 🔍 Approach

### 1️⃣ Define System Requirements

Outlined application and infrastructure needs, including:

Multi-zone fault tolerance
Dynamic scalability
Security and access control policies
Continuous monitoring and cost visibility

### 2️⃣ Set Up EC2 and Networking

Provisioned Amazon EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones.
Configured VPC, subnets, and security groups to ensure isolation and secure access.
Applied IAM roles for controlled permissions and automation scripts.

### 3️⃣ Implement Load Balancer

Configured an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic evenly across instances.
Enabled health checks for failover recovery.
Integrated HTTPS termination to enhance end-user security.

### 4️⃣ Enable Auto Scaling

Created Auto Scaling Groups to dynamically adjust EC2 capacity based on CPU and memory utilization.
Defined scaling policies for predictable, automated elasticity.
Used CloudWatch alarms for proactive scaling triggers.

### 5️⃣ Integrate Monitoring and DNS

Set up Amazon CloudWatch dashboards for real-time performance tracking.
Configured Amazon Route 53 for domain management and failover routing.
Deployed logs and metrics visualization to identify usage and bottlenecks.
